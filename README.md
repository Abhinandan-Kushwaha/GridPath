# Problem Statement

You are given a Grid (matrix) of N x M, where N,M >=1

Each cell in the matrix has a non-negative value denoting the cost of traversing that cell.

Initially you are at the position [1,1]. You have to reach to the cell [N,M] at minimum cost. You are only allowed to move 1 cell right or 1 cell down at a time.
